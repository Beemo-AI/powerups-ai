## Powerups 4 AI

Pre-built function calls to plugin to the GPT API.

Some powerups:

-   Search Google
-   Scrape a website
-   Crawl relevant links
-   And more coming soon...

## Why does this exist?

Well, whenever I would start a new project, I would have to copy paste the same function calls over and over.
And, so many of us just have to do that and it creates reinventing the wheel so many times.

## Goals

1. As I add features to (Constella App)[https://constella.app], I want to add the powerups I use here for other people to use.
2. Welcome contributions!
3. A website to browse the powerups
4. Self-hosted AI agent where you can select power-ups and deploy?
